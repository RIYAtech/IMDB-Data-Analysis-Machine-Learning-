# IMDB-Data-Analysis-Machine-Learning-
Using the IMDB Dataset finding the top rated movies, finding in which year there was the highest average revenue etc.....


First i have loaded the Dataset as CSV File.
I used Kaggle to get the Dataset..

Then import all the necessary packages to perform the Data Analysis on the DataSet
I used Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib

Here love watching Movies especially Adventure and Fictional Movies..
So by performing this Data Analysis on the IMDB Website's DataSet i can able to analyse which Movie has got the Highest Rating,
What are the top ranked movies etc..


To Visualize the information i used HeatMap,Barplot 

Have a look at my File :)
